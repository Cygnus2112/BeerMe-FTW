# BeerMe-FTW
A React/Redux version of the wildly popular [BeerMe!](https://github.com/Cygnus2112/BeerMe) iOS beer discovery app. This is just the front end, and is meant to be paired with the existing BeerMe! back end.

To run: 
- Clone the repo
- Install and run the BeerMe! back end ([find it here](https://github.com/Cygnus2112/BeerMe)), or, if you're feeling ambitious, make your own back end.
- Fire up your terminal and type:
  - "npm start" to install server and client dependencies
  - "webpack -w" to generate the bundle.js file and compile ES6 syntax
  - "npm start" to run the app on a local server
